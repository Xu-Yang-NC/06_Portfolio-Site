Link to the website: https://www.xyang7125.com/

This is a personal portfolio responsive website built on React. The breakpoint of the website is 1020px. The fixed navigation bar will turn into a collapsible navigation bar 
when the screen size is less than the breakpoint.  Swiper API was used in the projects section for presenting my other projects. EmailJS was used in the contact section for 
receiving messages from visitors. Toastify was used to notify the visitors when their message was successfully sent. The background picture on the welcome page is from Pexel by 
Josh Sorenson.
